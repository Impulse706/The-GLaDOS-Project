Making Super-Intelligent Super AI's for the Future.

#1. What is this?
The GLaDOS Project Is a group of People Using Different AIs to create a Large, Complex, Super-Intelligent Network. (Like GLaDOS).
What is GLaDOS? GLaDOS is a Fictional Character From The Portal Franchise. GLaDOS is depicted to be a ASI (Artifical Super Intelligence).
The Project Started As A Simple Goal, Build A Supercomputer.
Why? Another Yet Simple Reason; "Because Why Not?".

#2. How?
Using Complex AIs And Algorithms to reach our goal. 
The Completion Goal for this project is anywhere from January 31st, 2025 to March 21st, 2025.
Also, we're going to need some sponsors. Because we need GPUs. (Graphics Processing Unit) AKA, Pricey Brick that Draws Triangles really fast.

#3. Commits
Commits are expected every week. Actual delays may occur, (Not everyone's schedule is Perfect).
We would love to have a community helping bring this project to life. We will primarily be on Github.
